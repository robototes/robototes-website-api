### Software requirements

* `node.js` version 8 or greater is recommended
* `yarn` version 1.2.1 or greater is recommended

### <a id="configuration">Configuring the server</a>

The following environment variables can be set, the server will not start without the ones marked *required*:

* `IP` (*required, default `0.0.0.0`*) The IP to run the server on
* `PORT` (*required, default `3000`*) The port to listen for requests on
* `DEBUG` (*optional*) see [Debug mode](#debugmode)
* `TBA_SECRET_KEY` (*required*) The secret key used to verify the source and integrity of payloads
* `DATABASE_HOST` (*required*) The IP address that the MongoDB server is listening on
* `DATABASE_PORT` (*required*) The port that the MongoDB server is listening on

### <a id="testing">Testing</a>

We use [ava](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ava) and [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest)
to test the server, including our routing and middleware. When writing new tests, make sure to follow
the documentation of the libraries mentioned above. The tests can be found in the `code/tests` folder,
and can be run using the following:

```shell
yarn test
```

This will run the tests and create code coverage files using [nyc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc)
that can be submitted from a CI test to
[Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/robototes/robototes-website-api/branches/master) using the Codecov CLI.

We use [Semaphore CI](https://semaphoreci.com/robototes/robototes-website-api) as our CI/CD service. Once
tested, our code is deployed automatically to a staging site, and can be manually deployed to our
production server.

### <a id="debugmode">Debug mode</a>

The `DEBUG` environment variable is used by the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug)
module for logging. The recommended filter value is `robototes-website-api:*,http`, which will
show setup information, and log HTTP requests. These are enabled by default when the server is
run in development mode using the following command:

```shell
yarn dev
```

### Running in production

To run the server in production, make sure [debug mode](#debugmode) is disabled and the
[configuration variables](#configuration) are set correctly. Test the server, then run it using
the following command:

```shell
yarn start
```

### <a id="tba">The Blue Alliance</a>

[The Blue Alliance](https://www.thebluealliance.com/) is a service provided free of charge to FRC
teams for scouting, watching, and reliving the FIRST Robotics Competition. One such feature in
particular that we use is a subscription to webhooks that provide us with realtime event updates.
We use these webhooks to build a customized feed for our users with all events regarding our team.
